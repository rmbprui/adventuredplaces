It felt amazing knowing we had that option and I knew it was perfect for me.</p><p>The support you get in university is amazing, from mental support to help on the application process they make sure you are ready to start and finish your Placement. They are also there throughout the year to provide any kind of support. University offers you a week of workshops and lectures on how to apply and what to do or not if eventually going into an internship.</p><p>We were offered a specialised week on Placement with workshops and lectures on different topics like where to find opportunities, how to build a good CV, et cetera...</p><p>Going on placement right before final year has shown to improve your grades and help in deciding and managing your final year project. You could see this from University alumni who had undertaken placement before final year that would show better results overall.</p><p>It's up to you if you do take the opportunity or not but it's an opportunity that for most comes with endless benefits. With all the support and encouragement you get from all the University staff the process becomes fun and enthusiastic.</p>"

It's not that Portugal isn't the place to do it, in fact I'm loving my experience so far, it just made sense when factoring in all the difficulties that 2020 and COVID 19 brought to everyone.</p><p>I'm a UK student doing an Erasmus in my home country, not the choice of many but I am happy with my decision. It might seem like a waste not using this opportunity to travel to a different country but as we all face this sudden lifestyle change what's best than being at home safe with family? And still have the opportunity to grow professionally!</p><p>In my first week of work I've discovered new software, new ways of communicating within the architect's community and new tips to do an efficient and professional job. I was asked to renovate an interior with new software, AutoCAD. I had heard about AutoCAD and 3Ds Max in the past but never used any of them in a project, it was not easy in the beginning but when you want something, you do it even if it takes you some sleep hours.</p><p>During the weekend I went out to explore the city and discover what was new and what was different. It felt so good coming home, and I honestly feel like I never left.</p><p>I've had an amazing week and couldn't ask for a better internship induction.</p>"

If she's doing the 2D and 3D plans and sketches, I'm working on FF&E and mood boards and vice-versa in order to deliver the best project to the client.</p><p>In terms of Covid regulations for workplaces we don't have many, we only need to keep our maks and try to maintain distance, but as we are the only ones at the showroom it's all manageable.</p><p>We design for everyone, in fact, I make costume built-in cabinets and decor! The company tries to focus more on interiors and we've designed a lot of kitchens since the pandemic, people are more into cooking now :) But that doesn't mean we don't design exteriors, it's just not as common. If you want to change your space just bring your plans and talk to us about what you want to do!</p><p>I love being an Intern at GoodIn, I'm learning but at the same time having fun at what I do! To me, that is one of the most important things I can take from the job.</p><p>Here in the showroom we also sell some decor products and we are open Tuesday to Saturday from 10 am to 7 pm, if you want to come just to have a look at the products you can as well! We are here to welcome you with open arms.</p><p>Come makes us a visit âœ¨</p>"

I've decided to come to Portugal because there's nothing better than being home and having the opportunity to both be working and have your family around.</p><p>The University helps you so much when you choose this path, they explain to you how, why and when you should do your placement and have teams ready for both International and UK-based placements. If you decide you want to experience a placement year you will never feel like you are alone with no help. They have every type of support you can or could ever think of.</p><p>When you feel like it is the right moment to start this journey just talk with the Talent Team, if you are from Coventry University, if not I'm sure your Uni as a support team as well ready to help you out.</p><p>From the moment you first email them, they will never let you go onto the journey alone, you will have support meetings, they will help you make your CV, recommendation letter, and Portfolio if needed.</p><p>The Uni offers you lectures and online material that explain more about placements throughout the years, they will mention placements as early as 1st year so everyone has enough time to make a decision.</p><p>I'm doing a 9-month long placement. I am in the middle of the experience and already feeling more professional and more advanced in different software, types of work and materials. I feel like taking a placement in the middle of the course helps you because you grow as a professional as well as a person but at the same time have an insight into what you'll be doing in the future and if this is actually what you want to do.</p><p>When you have the opportunity to be working without a degree you learn how to work faster but do things with control and value, you learn that every second at work is a chance for you to grow more and more.</p><p>I feel like my placement is helping me become more independent and have a new sense of scale and dimension, this helps a lot when working in interiors. It is also helping me improve my work methods! Everyone needs that in the last year with final year projects. :) It's like having a great opportunity to develop new skills for the future and at the same time learn new tips professionally or not. You develop yourself as an individual.</p><p>Overall my experience is helping me understand what exactly I need to develop as an Interior Architect and how and what I need to deliver.</p>"
