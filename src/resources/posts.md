## The first week

06/12/2021

I got an internship in Portugal with Erasmus.

I would never think about Portugal as my destination for placement abroad. It's not that Portugal isn't the place to do it, in fact I'm loving my experience so far, it just made sense when factoring in all the difficulties that 2020 and COVID 19 brought to everyone.

I'm a UK student doing an Erasmus in my home country, not the choice of many but I am happy with my decision. It might seem like a waste not using this opportunity to travel to a different country but as we all face this sudden lifestyle change what's best than being at home safe with family? And still have the opportunity to grow professionally!

In my first week of work I've discovered new software, new ways of communicating within the architect's community and new tips to do an efficient and professional job. I was asked to renovate an interior with new software, AutoCAD. I had heard about AutoCAD and 3Ds Max in the past but never used any of them in a project, it was not easy in the beginning but when you want something, you do it even if it takes you some sleep hours.

During the weekend I went out to explore the city and discover what was new and what was different. It felt so good coming home, and I honestly feel like I never left.

I've had an amazing week and couldn't ask for a better internship induction.

## How University prepares you for Placement

29/11/2021

University offers you a lot of different types of support when it comes to Placement and all the challenges it creates.

In my first year we were briefed on what to do and what not to do at an Internship, this was where I found out that you could participate in a placement year before finishing the course. It felt amazing knowing we had that option and I knew it was perfect for me.

The support you get in university is amazing, from mental support to help on the application process they make sure you are ready to start and finish your Placement. They are also there throughout the year to provide any kind of support. University offers you a week of workshops and lectures on how to apply and what to do or not if eventually going into an internship.

We were offered a specialised week on Placement with workshops and lectures on different topics like where to find opportunities, how to build a good CV, et cetera...

Going on placement right before final year has shown to improve your grades and help in deciding and managing your final year project. You could see this from University alumni who had undertaken placement before final year that would show better results overall.

It's up to you if you do take the opportunity or not but it's an opportunity that for most comes with endless benefits. With all the support and encouragement you get from all the University staff the process becomes fun and enthusiastic.

## Becoming an International student

22/11/2021

I've always had the dream to study in the UK. A country full of opportunities, different cultures and places to discover.

When I discovered that I had the chance to enrol on an university in the UK it felt like my dream would finally happen. From the process of sending applications, to creating a portfolio and having interviews it felt like it was taking forever until the offer from the university came.

The day it did was magical as I had been offered an offer!

The moment to enter on the new adventure began so I packed my bags and onto the new journey I go!

From meeting new people, to discovering new cities and learning a whole bunch of new words the dream started!

It was amazing, all the support, the new learning methods and the people I had the chance to meet changed me as a person and my perspective on all these things.

I'm very thankful to have the chance to live an old dream I always had!

## Creating professional projects

13/12/2021

I was assigned a project for the store. One of the most intensive and challenging projects I've ever done in a professional way. I had to design a client's entire house!

The main idea of the project was to give the new home a comfortable and stylish interior, the client wanted a simple but quite unique design.

For the project development I used AutoCAD for the plans and Enscape and Photoshop for some renderings!

It's always a challenge working on professional projects for the first time, you learn new things, new working methods and you overcome difficulties that you don't have on personal projects. You need to adapt and not have fear of change.

But when your on an internship you are there to learn with your mistakes, get up and do better!

It has been a wonderful experience.

## Preparing for Christmas

20/12/2021

Working on an interior design store, I'm not only learning how to design on a professional level but also learning how to manage a store! With that comes managing deliveries, tracking inventory and decorating the store.

The Christmas time is here and we need to prepare ourselves for the most wonderful time of the year ðŸŽ„

It's amazing seeing that everyone wants to be involved in decorating the store.

Our plans began by choosing the theme and the colours. We chose red and white for the colours and the theme was Winter Wonderland. After that we began developing mood boards and decorating, and the store became a magical winter place that I loved to enter every day!

## Festive days

27/12/2021

Finally the Christmas week was here!

The city was covered in lights and Christmas magic, it was wonderful seeing all the places decorated for this wonderful time.

Family got reunited, everybody tested for Covid and we had the opportunity to celebrate Christmas and New Year's all together. It was an amazing time spending Christmas at home with the family!

After working during Christmas time you learn how everything is planned and you get this idea of how things are actually done behind the scenes.

Having this experience made me more mature and independent, 2 things I'm grateful for!
