            <h2>Hello and Welcome to my blog!</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Renata, I am a Portuguese, 20 years old and a BA
              Interior Architecture and Design student at Coventry University,
              UK.
            </p>
            <p>
              My biggest passions besides design are travelling, exploring
              different places and cultures and the best of them all meeting new
              people. I am an animal lover and saver and an avid movie lover
              always sneaking into a nice cinema when I get the chance.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have decided to undertake a placement year, as part of my
              studies to help me gain experience and I’m currently doing an
              internship as an Interior architect & showroom assistant at Good
              In- Interior Design, located in the vibrant and wonderful city of
              Braga, Portugal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve decided to create this blog as a way of documenting my first
              professional experience as an Interior Architect but also to share
              some of the adventures that might happen along the way in the
              Erasmus year abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within the blog I am aiming to share, the kind of projects we
              develop as Interior Architects, as well as to share a bit of my
              personal experience in my home country.
