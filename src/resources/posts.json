It felt amazing knowing we had that option and I knew it was perfect for me.</p><p>The support you get in university is amazing, from mental support to help on the application process they make sure you are ready to start and finish your Placement.

You could see this from University alumni who had undertaken placement before final year that would show better results overall.</p><p>It's up to you if you do take the opportunity or not but it's an opportunity that for most comes with endless benefits.

And still have the opportunity to grow professionally!</p><p>In my first week of work I've discovered new software, new ways of communicating within the architect's community and new tips to do an efficient and professional job. I was asked to renovate an interior with new software, AutoCAD. I had heard about AutoCAD and 3Ds Max in the past but never used any of them in a project, it was not easy in the beginning but when you want something, you do it even if it takes you some sleep hours.</p><p>During the weekend I went out to explore the city and discover what was new and what was different. It felt so good coming home, and I honestly feel like I never left.</p><p>I've had an amazing week and couldn't ask for a better internship induction.</p>"

The company tries to focus more on interiors and we've designed a lot of kitchens since the pandemic, people are more into cooking now :) But that doesn't mean we don't design exteriors, it's just not as common. If you want to change your space just bring your plans and talk to us about what you want to do!</p><p>I love being an Intern at GoodIn, I'm learning but at the same time having fun at what I do! To me, that is one of the most important things I can take from the job.</p><p>Here in the showroom we also sell some decor products and we are open Tuesday to Saturday from 10 am to 7 pm, if you want to come just to have a look at the products you can as well! We are here to welcome you with open arms.</p><p>Come makes us a visit âœ¨</p>"

If you decide you want to experience a placement year you will never feel like you are alone with no help. They have every type of support you can or could ever think of.</p><p>When you feel like it is the right moment to start this journey just talk with the Talent Team, if you are from Coventry University, if not I'm sure your Uni as a support team as well ready to help you out.</p><p>From the moment you first email them, they will never let you go onto the journey alone, you will have support meetings, they will help you make your CV, recommendation letter, and Portfolio if needed.</p><p>The Uni offers you lectures and online material that explain more about placements throughout the years, they will mention placements as early as 1st year so everyone has enough time to make a decision.</p><p>I'm doing a 9-month long placement. I am in the middle of the experience and already feeling more professional and more advanced in different software, types of work and materials. I feel like taking a placement in the middle of the course helps you because you grow as a professional as well as a person but at the same time have an insight into what you'll be doing in the future and if this is actually what you want to do.</p><p>When you have the opportunity to be working without a degree you learn how to work faster but do things with control and value, you learn that every second at work is a chance for you to grow more and more.</p><p>I feel like my placement is helping me become more independent and have a new sense of scale and dimension, this helps a lot when working in interiors. It is also helping me improve my work methods! Everyone needs that in the last year with final year projects. :) It's like having a great opportunity to develop new skills for the future and at the same time learn new tips professionally or not. You develop yourself as an individual.</p><p>Overall my experience is helping me understand what exactly I need to develop as an Interior Architect and how and what I need to deliver.</p>"

We do have another architect in the company head office, not working alongside us here in the showroom, but working for GoodIn.</p><p>I've finally got the chance to see how she works and what type of work she has to deliver and it's kinda interesting how in the same company different people in different places can do opposite things. As we in the showroom are more focused on residential and living interiors she in the head office does more of commercial ones, like hotels and shopping stores.</p><p>She does work with the same software that we do but in terms of work, she needs to develop more organized and clean drawings and work, as we are talking about 10 or 15 rooms instead of 1 or 2! The work is basically the same draw the plans, do the elevations and details, mood board to propose the project to the client and then propose the project.</p><p>Although she works with commercial projects, sometimes she has to work on residential ones as well and it was interesting seeing how she develops the same things we do but with a completely different approach.</p><p>As I was taught here in the showroom we firstly are e-mailed by the client with what he wants and needs for the project based on that we develop a presentation with different pictures and ideas and give them a call to come and pop us a visit in the store and have a little chat about the project involved, as we have space and the right materials to do it.</p><p>In the head office the process is a little different as in there we have everyone working as financial people, carpenters, architects and the boss office so the client's approach is different as the architect calls them on a zoom meeting and they discuss everything about the project. After that, the process is the same draw everything and send it to the client for approval! Then if it's approved send everything to production and wait to be finished to be instaled and decorated!</p><p>It was a different week dealing with the first part of the process in a different way but I really liked how it felt, it was good to pop out of my comfort zone and experience new things.</p>"

So I search it and I was amazed when I first saw Ander Alencar, a Brazilian 3D artist, renders they are just like normal pictures as he says pictures that are created in the technical world. I will leave one of his renders and you can check that one and many more on his Instagram: @anderalencar!</p><p>Before starting to explain how everything went let me explain to you what 3D renders are, 3D rendering is the process of turning information from a 3D model into a 2D image you probably came across one of these when seeing cartoons or flipping through a magazine! In fact, this type of image is becoming very popular for people that work with visual stuff, just like us interior architects that have to sell an idea so making that come to life helps us a lot!</p><p>Onto the course week we go:</p><p>The day to start the course came and let me tell you I wasn't too excited at first because my experience with 3D is not the best you learn to work with it in university and stuff but when you enter the professional world and everything is so professionally and carefully made you start to think that maybe investing in your career is the best option so that was what I did. As soon as the class started my mind changed.</p><p>The first class was a theoretical one where we learned about the renders, how can you make them look good and fresh, the different moods that can be used, colours and lens of a photographic cam so you can take pictures of your 3D drawing and make it a 2D image; when you hear this you think, why will I be needing that? Trust me you will, your renders will change completely if you learn about these things, this is the stuff you need to be investing in knowing what's behind.</p><p>The course went smoothly and the following lectures were more about how to sell the drawings, how to edit them and choose your target audience. This last point is a crucial one because choosing your audience will be helping you save a lot of time!</p><p>Although I had to make an effort to attend the course it was a valuable one and I completely advise you to do one as well.</p>"
