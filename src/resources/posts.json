    "description": "<p>University offers you a lot of different types of support when it comes to Placement and all the challenges it creates.</p><p>In my first year we were briefed on what to do and what not to do at an Internship, this was where I found out that you could participate in a placement year before finishing the course. It felt amazing knowing we had that option and I knew it was perfect for me.</p><p>The support you get in university is amazing, from mental support to help on the application process they make sure you are ready to start and finish your Placement. They are also there throughout the year to provide any kind of support. University offers you a week of workshops and lectures on how to apply and what to do or not if eventually going into an internship.</p><p>We were offered a specialised week on Placement with workshops and lectures on different topics like where to find opportunities, how to build a good CV, et cetera...</p><p>Going on placement right before final year has shown to improve your grades and help in deciding and managing your final year project. You could see this from University alumni who had undertaken placement before final year that would show better results overall.</p><p>It's up to you if you do take the opportunity or not but it's an opportunity that for most comes with endless benefits. With all the support and encouragement you get from all the University staff the process becomes fun and enthusiastic.</p>"

    "description": "<p>I got an internship in Portugal with Erasmus.</p><p>I would never think about Portugal as my destination for placement abroad. It's not that Portugal isn't the place to do it, in fact I'm loving my experience so far, it just made sense when factoring in all the difficulties that 2020 and COVID 19 brought to everyone.</p><p>I'm a UK student doing an Erasmus in my home country, not the choice of many but I am happy with my decision. It might seem like a waste not using this opportunity to travel to a different country but as we all face this sudden lifestyle change what's best than being at home safe with family? And still have the opportunity to grow professionally!</p><p>In my first week of work I've discovered new software, new ways of communicating within the architect's community and new tips to do an efficient and professional job. I was asked to renovate an interior with new software, AutoCAD. I had heard about AutoCAD and 3Ds Max in the past but never used any of them in a project, it was not easy in the beginning but when you want something, you do it even if it takes you some sleep hours.</p><p>During the weekend I went out to explore the city and discover what was new and what was different. It felt so good coming home, and I honestly feel like I never left.</p><p>I've had an amazing week and couldn't ask for a better internship induction.</p>"
